  <section class="page-study-container">
    <div class="case-study">
      <h2>Every project begins somewhere…</h2>
      <p class="size-2">On the ConquerTheWorld project (also called as “CTW” for the intimates), I was given the mission to design a website for a language course, which works with face-to-face and online classes.</p>
      <p class="size-1">The platform had to be a friendly for both public, and would also need some power of convincing stundents to join the course.</p>
      <h2>My Role in the Project</h2>
      <p class="size-1">As the only UX/UI designer in the project, I was responsable for the following activities:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Analyzing competitors to find out good practices they were doing
        <li>Initial sketches for the project</li>
        <li>Low fidelity wireframe</li>
        <li>High fidelity prototype</li>
        <li>Usability study for the website in order to confirm if the user experience and flow were adequate and easy to follow</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Studying Other Players</h2>
      <p class="size-2">At first, we decided to conduct a research with other popular courses to analyze the experience they were offering on their websites. Most of them were very similar in a lot of aspects, such as allowing the students to find nearby units, different options for subscriptions, etc.</p>
      <h2>First Sketches</h2>
      <p class="size-2">After the studies were complete, I began with the first skecthes. The idea was to have a double-option homepage, each one focused on a group of students (face-to-face or online).</p>
      <p class="size-1">It would be able to switch between them just by clicking the tab in the top of the page.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="images-grid-1">
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - Wireframe 1.jpg" alt="Wireframes from both main screens">
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - Wireframe 2.jpg" alt="Wireframes for player and courses screens">
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <p class="size-2">We also did wireframes for the player screen, for online students, which was highly influenced by YouTube, since it’s a very commom platform that everyone already knows how to use.</p>
      <h2>Choosing Colors and Fonts</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="images-grid-4">
      <p class="size-1 img-col-1 center">When choosing colors, we kept the main orange that would be on the brand, but also added some variations so we could work with contrast and grandients.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - Colors and Fonts.png" alt="Colors and fonts chosen for the project" class="stretch">
      <p class="size-1 center">As for the fonts, we chose Roboto, which is very common, for most of the text, and Josefin Sans, which would deliver a elegant look to titles and buttons.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <div class="images-grid-3">
        <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - Wireframe 3.png" alt="Digital wireframe for the CTW project" class="responsive img-row-1">
        <p class=" size-1 center">They would act as a landing page, allowing the user to search for nearby units (if looking for face-to-face classes) or prices for subscription (if looking for online classes)</p>
      </div>
      <h2>The Execution</h2>
      <p class="size-1">The project ended out being very complex, with almost a thousand interactions in total.</p>
      <p class="size-2">It’s possible to see a lot of orange in the main pages, as to reinforce the brand’s identity. Each homepage has a specific form to be filled and capture the lead. The data we asked is only the minimun required, in order to respect data protection laws.</p>
      <p class="size-1">We also used a lot of illustration, which fill the page in a harmonic way.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="images-grid-1">
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - Classes 01.png" alt="">
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - Classes 02.png" alt="">
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <p class="size-2">As you may have seen, there’s lots of convincing elements which are natural to a landpage. So, first, we convince the student that they need to learn a new language, then we show why the should choose CTW and what other people have said about their experience with CTW.</p>
      <p class="size-2">There’s also free content available in return for subscribing your mail address.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - 01 Login.png" alt="">
      <p class="size-2">The Login/Register screen is pretty simple, as it gives both options in one screen, being quicker than having to change from one to another. There’s also a quick login option with social media, as these have become very popular.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - 02 Classes.png" alt="">
      <p class="size-2">After a successfully login, the user will be greeted with this page with simple options. They will be able to select the language they want to study and multiple courses will appear in a list right below.</p>
      <p class="size-2">The students will also have access to a limited amount of weekly live meetings, according to the plan they choose. They can schedule it through the area at the bottom. They can choose to select a time and date and see what teachers are available or they can choose a teacher and see their schedule.</p>
      <p class="size-2">It’s also possible to follow next scheduled classes in the right area.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/CTW/CTW - 03 Player.png" alt="">
      <p class="size-2">As for the player, as previously explained, its functions and visuals were mostly taken from the YouTube visuals, mixed with CTW’s ID. It’s possible to see previous/next classes in the bottom of the screen, similar to what you’d see in a playlist in YouTube.</p>
      <p class="size-2">There’s also some highlight to the teacher’s name, as the student will be able to schedule classes with them, if they like their teaching style.</p>
