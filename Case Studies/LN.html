  <section class="page-study-container">
    <div class="case-study">
      <h2 class="first">“If you’re not online, you don’t exist”</h2>
      <p class="size-2">This is a very common thought now-a-days and it is entirely true, and Cecilia and Lucia Navarro were very well aware of that. LN Makes is a small marketplace for make-ups with affordable prices. Soon, the business was going so well that they decided it was time to expand the business and go online.</p>
      <h2>My Role in the Project</h2>
      <p class="size-2">As the only UX/UI designer in the project, I was responsable for the following activities:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Analyzing competitors to find out good practices they were doing</li>
        <li>Initial sketches for the project</li>
        <li>Low fidelity wireframe</li>
        <li>High fidelity prototype</li>
        <li>Usability study for the website in order to confirm if the user experience and flow were adequate and easy to follow</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>First meeting</h2>
      <p class="size-2">On my first meeting with Cecilia and Lucia, I looked for understanding the message they wanted to send to their costumers. In order to do that, I conducted a simple questionary:</p>
      <h3>What problem your product solves for your client?</h3>
      <p class="size-2">“In general lines, you could say it helps people with their self-esteem”</p>
      <h3>How do you work your product now-a-days?</h3>
      <p class="size-2">“We look for accessible and inclusive products, so everyone can buy them. We use social media (Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp) for marketing. As for the deliveries, we do them ourselves, through train stations or places near our house.”</p>
      <h3>What does “success” means to you?</h3>
      <p class="size-2">“Satisfied and engaged customers, that will share their experience with our products to friends. And, of course, selling a lot.”</p>
      <h3>What is stopping you from achieving success?</h3>
      <p class="size-2">“We need to expand our costumers and sell in larger amounts. As our products tend to be cheap, the amount is what matters for our profit.”</p>
      <p class="size-1">“The customer will have an experience as comfortable as going to a store and being able to try and ask anything.”</p>
      <h2>Fonts and Colors</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="images-grid-4">
      <p class="size-2 img-col-1 img-row-1">As for colors, we went with the pink already used in the brand and made slight variations, so we could explore gradients and alternatives for higher contrast.</p>
      <p class="size-1 img-col-1 img-row-2">The idea here was to emphasize the identity throughout all social media.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Colors and Fonts.png" alt="Main colors and fonts chosen" class="img-col-2">
      <p class="size-2 img-col-3 img-row-1">For fonts, we chose Poppins, which is very common and easy to read for most parts of the website, and Freestyle Script for titles and important sections.</p>
      <p class="size-1 img-col-3 img-row-2">As the name suggests, this is a script style font, so it matches the idea of “art” in make-ups</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <p class="size-2">Another interesting point here is that for the grey scale, we used slightly pink colours, as you can see in the image below. This will further create a communication between sections and colors used.</p>
    </div>
    <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Colors 2.png" alt="Grey scale chosen for the LN Makes Project" class="stretch">
    <div class="case-study">
      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      <p class="size-2">The first wireframes were focuses on the main screen. As a new business online, it was important to assure to possible costumers the company's reliability.</p>
      <p class="size-1">We would have an entire section dedicated to show brand partners</p>
    </div>
    <div class="images-grid-5">
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Wireframe - Home Web.png" alt="homescreen's wireframe for web">
      <p class="size-3 img-row-2">Web homescreen</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Wireframe - Products Web.png" alt="product's screen wireframe for web">
      <p class="size-3 img-row-2">Web product's page</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Wireframe - Home Mobile.png" alt="homescreen's wireframe for mobile" class="mobile">
      <p class="size-3 img-row-2">Mobile homescreen</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Wireframe - Products Mobile.png" alt="product's screen wireframe for mobile" class="mobile">
      <p class="size-3 img-row-2">Mobile product's page</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <p class="size-2">But it would have double purpose, as it would allow people to filter the products on the website just by clicking on the brand’s logo.</p>
      <p class="size-2">We also planned on highlighting the main categories on the main page.</p>
      <p class="size-2">The footer would again reinforce the business’s authority, by displaying security certificates.</p>
      <h2>The Great Result</h2>
      <p class="size-2">After the approval of the wireframes and the website general identity, I started designing the first prototypes.</p>
      <p class="size-2">Be aware that as the project was made for a brazilian company, most of the screenshots below will have elements in portuguese</p>
      <p class="size-1">The homescreen would welcome the costumer with a very feminine approach, making good use of the brand’s pink.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Image 1.jpg" alt="">
      <p class="size-1">Scrolling down a bit, the user will find a section with the most popular product categories and some partners</p>
      <p class="size-2">He will be able to just click any partner’s logo and automatically apply a filter in the product search just for that brand</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Image 2.png" alt="">
      <p class="size-1">At the very bottom of the page, there’s a footer with the sitemap, some contact info and social media and security credentials.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Image 3.png" alt="">
      <p class="size-2">By clicking on “our products” or any category, the costumer will be directed to the products page. This page follows some standards for e-commerces, it was made this way to ease the user flow, which will most likely be already used to this style.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Image 4.png" alt="">
      <p class="size-2">The user will be able to filter the results by a lot of criterias, such as brand, available colors, and price range, making it easier for shopping.</p>
      <p class="size-2">Below each product you can also see a list of available colors. By clicking on the one you want, the product image preview will change to its variant.</p>
      <p class="size-2">After adding the products to their cart, the costumer will need to login/register before checking-out</p>
    </div>
    <div class="images-grid-6">
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Image 5.png" alt="" class="pos-col-1 img-row-1">
      <p class="size-3 pos-col-1">Login screen</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/LN Makes/LN - Image 6.png" alt="" class="pos-col-2 img-row-1">
      <p class="size-3 pos-col-2">Register screen</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <p class="size-2">The final screen would be the cart/finishing order screen.</p>
      <p class="size-1">We wanted to make this process as simple as possible, so costumers won’t give up for overcomplication.</p>
      <p class="size-2">They will type their adresses, select the kind of delivery they would like (standard, express or in-hands).</p>
      <p class="size-2">After that, the costumer will choose the payment method and confirm the buy. A pop-up will confirm it and a number ID will be generated, so they can always keep track about the product status until delivery.</p>
