  <section class="page-study-container">
    <div class="case-study">
      <p class="size-1 first">My work at Klep’s project began with the first contact from doctor Michelangelo, a renowned surgeon. He wanted to create an app, alongside some of his friends, that would allow patients to schedule appointments to doctors, as well as exams.</p>
      <h2>My role in the project</h2>
      <p class="size-1">As the lead and only UI/UX designer in the project, my role comprehends everything since the ideation proccess until the fully functional prototype, that includes:</p>
      <ul class="size-2 list">
        <li>Similar website and app analysis, as well as the most used heuristics;
        <li>Initial researches and personas creation</li>
        <li>Drawing the first sketches for the project</li>
        <li>Wireframing and lo-fi prototype</li>
        <li>Final hi-fi prototype</li>
        <li>Usability tests for purposes validations</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Identifying user’s needs</h2>
      <p class="size-1">In our initial researches, we tried to identify the main problems that weren’t adressed by today’s solutions in the market.</p>
      <p class="size-2">In order to do that, I executed an anonymous research through social media. With its results, I was able to draw personas that would fit the groups with most interest in this app.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="images-grid-1">
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Persona - Leo.jpg" alt="First Persona Created" class="responsive">
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Persona - Martha.jpg" alt="Second Persona Created" class="responsive">
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <p class="size-1">We decided that a clean and simple UI would be the best for both cases, since it would be faster and easier to navigate.</p>
      <h2>First sketches</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="images-grid-2">
      <p class="size-1">Our first sketches for the project were focused on the login/register screen, the home screen and the search screen.</p>
      <p class="size-1">The idea was to offer the user as many possibilities we could, while also keeping it simple, so they wouldn’t feel lost.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Paper Sketch.jpg" alt="First sketches of the project" class="responsive">
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <h2>Fonts and Colours</h2>
      <p class="size-2">As for the colours, we wanted something health related. That could be red, green or blue. Red was too alarming, green was already being used by other players in the market, leaving us with the blue.</p>
      <p class="size-1">We chose a cyan to blue scale that would give a calm and clean look for the app’s UI.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Klep - Colors and Fonts.png" alt="Colors and Fonts chosen for the project" class="responsive">
      <p class="size-1">As for the fonts, we chose Source Sans Pro and Rubik, as they are both easy to read, being benefitial for older people.</p>
      <p class="size-2">Rubik was used for buttons and actionable texts, while Souce Sans Pro was used for basically anything else.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="case-study">
      <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      <p class="size-1">With the first definitions done and approved, I started working on the wireframes</p>
      <p class="size-2">Beware that as the app was made for a brazilian company, most of the images below will have portuguese text</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Klep - Wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe of the Klep Project" class="responsive">
      <p class="size-2">As our greatest goal was to create an easy to use app, with accessibility for different groups and needs in mind, all the buttons had enough space, the font sizes were well thought and the text had to be clear</p>
      <h2>The Final Project</h2>
      <p class="size-2">As of today, after installing the Klep app, the user will be met with a login/register screen with quick login options through social media (Google or Facebook account).</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Klep - Image 1.png" alt="" class="responsive">
      <p class="size-2">Following that, the user will be directed to the home screen. Here we have addopted a highly graphical approach, so every option has a corresponding icon. This will make the user flow easier to follow, as the images are easier to remember than pure text.</p>
      <div class="images-grid-3">
        <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Klep - Image 2.png" alt="" class="responsive">
        <p class="size-2">By clicking in one of the options (doctors or exams), the user will be able to filter the results according to his needs.</p>
        <p class="size-2">Both the speciality and exam spaces can be typed to further filter the options available in the dropdown menu, making it easier to navigate through the multiple options available.</p>
        <p class="size-2">We also chose to keep the access to the forum for doubts there, as the user might change his mind if he just has a simple question to be made.</p>
        <p class="size-2 resize-text">This forum is a functionality we want to introduce in the app as it could be a tool for younger and unexperienced doctors attract more patients. It would also be a space for sharing knowledge that wasn’t available in any competitors we’d seen, therefore it would be a nice way to get new users.</p>
        <p class="size-2 resize-text">The doctor’s option will bring both face-to-face appointments, as well as telemedicine. The last one has been a preference for many users.</p>
      </div>
      <p class="size-2">After searching for a doctor or exam, the user will be able to see the results and order them according to their preferences, such as the closest, the best reviews or the cheapest. Every result is integrated with the Google Maps, so the user can simply click on the “view map” option and plan their route to the hospital/clinic.</p>
      <p class="size-2">The design choices for iconography and colors is consistent througout all the screens, as you can see in the images below.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Klep - Image 3.jpg" alt="" class="responsive">
      <p class="size-2">Once you’ve selected a doctor, you’ll be able to see more details about them and, right below, there will be an schedule option with all available dates and times.</p>
      <p class="size-2">Klep will also keep record of all previous data, such as exams and previous doctors so the user can always check back on it. These information will be encrypted for the user protection and will never be user by Klep in any ways.</p>
      <p class="size-2">At this same screen, users will be able to leave anonymous reviews for their doctors.</p>
      <p class="size-2">There’s also an option to contact them (if the doctor has enabled) with a insta chat. This way, doctors can receive updates on their patients status and responses to the treatments.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Case Studies/Klep/Klep - Image 4.png" alt="" class="responsive">
      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p class="size-2">Accessibility has been thought throughout the entire design. It’s possible to see, for example, the use of high contrast colors in all screens, for people of age or with eye-related disabilities. There’s also clear feedback, which will help elders.</p>
      <p class="size-2">Sending/receiving audios while speaking to doctors is another way to access users’ pains, as researches show that elder people have difficulties while using on-screen keyboard, whereas sending audio messages is much easier and quicker for them. This will also help people with motor or visual disabilities.</p>
